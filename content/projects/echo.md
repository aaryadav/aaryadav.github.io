Combining large language models with other tools and custom UIs enables building helpful agents and "answer engines".
Some examples of this include [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) and [ChatGPT Plugins](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).

In this project, I experimented with features like web search, code-focused UI, pop-up menus, and tiling-window views, aiming to create a more productive environment for interacting with language models.
