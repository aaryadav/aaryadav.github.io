**I. THE PLAN?**  
Suppose we have a 50 citizens who are:
smart, hard working, tech+culture+policy autists
to help provide detailed reports, insights, and concrete action plans with the goal of to provide and/or improve the following

1. clean air
2. cheap food
3. cheap electricity
4. cheap healthcare
5. cheap housing
5. free education
6. individual freedom
7. equal rights
8. roads
9. planned urban/rural infrastructure (road network, public transport, sidewalks, parks, libraries)
10. clean cities/better waste management
11. Smooth and efficient judiciary

what tools can we build for them to empower them to find and gather information faster, identify and learn about systems, policies, bottlenecks, workflow minutae, etc, and enact the changes they want to see

**II. FEATURE IDEAS:**  
Offers dashboards that display key performance indicators (KPIs)
for clean air, food prices, energy costs, healthcare metrics,
housing affordability, education accessibility, and even judicial efficiency.

1. policy:  
annotated reports  
version-controlled policy drafts  

2. judiciary  
analyze case durations  
backlog statistics  

3. identify actors:  
government agencies, NGOs, private sector players, and community groups.

4. progress of proposed changes

5. Crowdsourced Data Collection Mobile App
interface for citizens to report local issuesâ€”like:  
local school conditions  
polluted areas  
poorly maintained sidewalks  
inadequate street lighting  
road damage  
problematic waste disposal practices  
noise levels  
green spaces
