I'm currently making [Orb](https://orb.superwrapper.xyz/), a tool to search and understand code faster.

I enjoy building intuitive, functional and beautiful web-based tools.  

Books Iâ€™m reading
- Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products - Leander Kahney
- A Short History of Nearly Everything - Bill Bryson
